# JokeMachine
An android app I made as a gift to someone special. 
If you're not connected to the internet it has a in-built set of jokes that it uses, but if you are connected to the internet, it uses
Parse, as a backend, and takes jokes stored there. It has one-liners, and multiple lined jokes, as well as a bunch of features tailored
specifically for that special someone..
